# 🌟 My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This site is built with **React** to showcase my skills, projects, and freelancing services.  
I designed it to be **clean, responsive, and professional**, making it easy for clients and recruiters to explore my work.
I made it very simple for now but as my experience grows I will update it and the contact form is not yet working i will make it send emails to the clients.
